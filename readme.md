## About Budgeteer

Budgeteer is my first Laravel Framework based Project (about 2 years+ ago).
With it you can handle your cash and see where your money is gone ;-)

Next version would be come with Laravel API Backend and VueJS2 Frontend, maybe.

Give me Feedback or buy me a beer please :-)

### Interessting code...

- Take a look at the web routes (./routes/web.php) for an simplified installation.
- Take a look at the bin folder
- Anyway take a look at the code if you want ;-)

### Wanna give a try?

Just download the two files under ***_deploy*** and upload it to your webspace. 
Call the install.php script in your browser and have fun.
